We have n servers with m attackers.
The hacker has probability p to penetrate each server.
Make a graphical representation (line flat if hacker doesn't penetrate and a jump to 1 if he penetrates), try different n,m,p.
At time n we want to count how many reached each level.
Useful funcions: random, drawlines, drawrectangle
